# K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the use of **K-Means** and **Mini-Batch K-Means** clustering algorithms on multiple datasets using Python and Scikit-Learn.  
It visualizes clustering steps, evaluates model performance, and compares efficiency between methods.

---

## Overview

This lab implements several unsupervised learning techniques, focusing on clustering and model evaluation.  
It covers:
- K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models on the Iris dataset  
- Visualization of cluster boundaries and centroids  
- Performance comparison between K-Means and Mini-Batch K-Means  
- Elbow method and Silhouette analysis for optimal `k` selection  
- Timing and inertia evaluation for different cluster counts

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization:** Clear plots of clustering boundaries and performance metrics.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Comparison of inertia, silhouette scores, and training time.  
- **Practical Example:** Use of the Iris and synthetic blob datasets.  
- **Optimization:** Demonstrates K-Means initialization, convergence, and batch processing.

## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
