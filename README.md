# KMeans-Clustering-Analysis
Implementation and visualization of K-Means Clustering and Mini-Batch K-Means using Python and Scikit-Learn. This lab explores clustering concepts through the Iris dataset and synthetic data, demonstrating the clustering process, inertia, silhouette analysis, and performance comparison between standard and mini-batch algorithms.
